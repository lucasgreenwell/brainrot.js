						duration * dialogueTransitions
					} exchanges, aiming for a concise transcript that would last between ${duration} minutes. The person attribute should either be ${agentA} or ${agentB}. The line attribute should be that character's line of dialogue. It should be risque and edgy, so as to be interesting to watch. I also need an asset description under the asset attribute which would be a relevant search query to find an image which should be relevant to the overall topic of the conversation. The asset descriptions shouldn't be vague, but a description of something that you think would be a good image to go along with the conversation. Specificity is key. And don't include a direct mention of a politician in assets, if for example, Trump is mentioned, don't use the word Trump in the asset description, but instead something like white male with blonde hair combover ya know. The JSON format WHICH MUST BE ADHERED TO ALWAYS is as follows: { transcript: { [ {'person': 'the exact value of ${agentA} or ${agentB} depending on who is talking', 'line': 'their line of conversation in the dialog', asset: 'relevant search query based on the current line'} ] } }`,
