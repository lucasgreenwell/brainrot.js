    summary:
        "A dimly lit alcove tucked away in the Exchange's black market section, illuminated only by flickering neon signs from nearby vendors. Red Pill stands partially concealed behind stacked supply crates, nervously checking over their shoulder every few moments. Shadow emerges from a hidden service corridor, their form barely distinguishable from the darkness except for occasional glints of light reflecting off their surface. The two speak in hushed tones, with Shadow occasionally gesturing toward a handheld device displaying what appears to be security footage. White Pill observes from behind a merchant's abandoned stall roughly 30 feet away, crouched low and hidden among discarded packaging materials. The tension is palpable as Red Pill's normally confident demeanor appears shaken, their movements becoming increasingly agitated as the conversation progresses. Shadow maintains a calm, almost predatory presence, occasionally placing a reassuring hand on Red's shoulder that seems to make Red even more uncomfortable. The ambient sounds of distant market activity and dripping pipes provide cover for their whispered exchange, while the steam from nearby vents creates an ethereal atmosphere that further obscures their meeting from casual observers.",
