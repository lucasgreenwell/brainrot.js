# API Conversion Implementation Plan

## Overview
Convert the existing dockerized video generation application into an API service while maintaining the core video generation functionality.

## Tasks

### Analysis and Setup
- [x] Review existing endpoints in transcribe.py (the file referenced in Dockerfile's CMD)
- [x] Identify the minimal set of changes needed to expose video generation as an API

### API Implementation
- [x] Create a new endpoint for video generation that accepts POST requests
- [x] Implement request validation using existing validateParams function
- [x] Adapt generateVideo function to work in API context
- [x] Implement proper error handling and response formatting

### Docker Configuration
- [x] Modify Dockerfile to expose the API port properly
- [x] Update the Gunicorn configuration to handle API requests
- [x] Remove daemon mode to ensure proper container operation

### Documentation
- [x] Create API documentation with endpoint specifications
- [x] Update README.md with API usage instructions
- [x] Document any new configuration requirements

### Testing
- [ ] Test API endpoint with curl/Postman
- [ ] Verify video generation still works as expected
- [ ] Document example requests and responses
