During a recent rebranc we changed the UI names of many of our pages without making substantial changes to the code. Below is a mapping of those rebaranded terms in case the user uses these. 

The Teachin Time tab is the [upload_video_page.dart](mdc:lib/pages/upload_video_page.dart). 

The Lesson Lane page is the [video_feed_widget.dart](mdc:lib/widgets/video_feed/video_feed_widget.dart) displayed on the [main.dart](mdc:lib/main.dart) home page. 

The Dig Deep page is the [favorites_tab.dart](mdc:lib/widgets/profile/favorites_tab.dart). 

The My Corner page is the [profile_page.dart](mdc:lib/profile_page.dart)
